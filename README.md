# seqpresser
Suite of obscure custom tools for manipulating bioinformatics data

The following scripts are included in this package:

stapler - tool for mapping SRA reads to reference genomes and quickly appending coordinate info to reads for downstream graphing
sim2graph - similar to stapler, but simulates reads from reference genome instead of mapping real reads
